### IMPORTANT!
Migrating the database, so the temporary user register isn't working, but you can see a video preview of how it looks like ðŸ™‚

<h2>Users should be able to:</h2>

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- Create an account
  - View the history of purchases and details of each order
  - Change profile picture
  - How long has account
  - All spent money

<h3>And other minor tools like...</h3>

- husky, validator.js, cookie.js, react-spinners, react-toastify, eslint, and so on...

<h2>What could I do better</h2>

- Use clsx + twMerge for creating more reusable components
- Use Zod for better typescript types incoming data from API, problably I would change zod instead yup
- Should write simpler and less complex function for easier unit testing
- Use Redux or at least reducer in CartProvider. I did not expect it to grow so much

<h2>What I've learned?</h2>

- Strapi Headless CMS and how to upload backend to the cloud
- I've practice a lot of REST queries
- how to write basic unit tests using RTL and Jest
- Deepened my knowladge in the field of SSR and SSG
- how to use .husky

<h2>What next?</h2>

- In meantime I'll write more unit tests for this app.
